# [`React Native Navigation`](https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation) with [`Expo Modules`](https://github.com/expo/expo)

## Why

Since wix/react-native-navigation cause errors when installed with expo-modules, here's a starter project that works both on iOS and Android (tested).

### Usage

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/starters-dev/rnn-with-expo.git App && cd App
> yarn && cd ios/ && pod install
```
